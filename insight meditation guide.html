Read the <a href="insight meditation theory.html">insight meditation theory</a> page if you’d like to know the benefits of this practice and the reasoning for these instructions. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Establish basic <a href="mindfulness meditation guide.html">mindfulness</a>.

<li>
Notice a sensation.

<li>
Assign a mental label to that sensation. Then return to step 2.

</ol>

<p>
I will refer to the process of noticing and assigning a mental label as ‘noting’. Try to get to the point where you can note multiple sensations per second. One a second is a good pace for a beginner. A good way to start if you've only been doing mindfulness so far is by making certain to note every single in- and out-breath that you take.
</p>

<p>
To give you an idea of this is like, here is an example of the mental labels I might generate during a typical session.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
in-breath

<li>
right toe

<li>
right heel

<li>
left shoulder

<li>
fantasy

<li>
stomach

<li>
planning

<li>
forehead

<li>
hunger

<li>
right palm

<li>
sound

<li>
left ear

<li>
butt

<li>
fantasy

<li>
lower back

<li>
out-breath

</ul>

<p>
As you can see, a lot goes on between breaths! This example is actually noting at only a moderate rate of one per second (thanks to my long practice of mindful breathing, I breath about four times a minute when I’m really grooving). Allow your attention to move as it likes, and just note without judgment.
