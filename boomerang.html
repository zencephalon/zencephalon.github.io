<p>
When a dear friend wishes to depart
</p>

<p>
Don't hold on tight or U might fart
</p>

<p>
Restraint becomes resentment
</p>

<p>
or it could lead to derangement
</p>

<p>
so release them from arrangements
</p>

<p>
With good cheer give them a lift
</p>

<p>
Cherish together the time U have left
</p>

<p>
Thank them for their good acts
</p>

<p>
Say U love them and other facts
</p>

<p>
When a dear friend wishes to depart
</p>

<p>
Let go, smile, and take heart
</p>

<p>
Remember,
</p>

<p>
If not this trip,
</p>

<p>
then still that final trip,
</p>

<p>
the one into mystery,
</p>

<p>
will RIP them, STRIP them into history,
</p>

<p>
take them far away like a spaceship
</p>

<p>
and Thus we only borrow our friendship
</p>

<p>
When a dear friend wishes to depart
</p>

<p>
Do all U can to give them a jumpstart
</p>

<p>
Like a boomerang, joyously fling them into the distance
</p>

<p>
aim to let them fly with minimal resistance
</p>

<p>
give them ample leeway
</p>

<p>
and don't worry if they splay
</p>

<p>
and then who can say
</p>

<p>
that one day
</p>

<p>
they won't fly astray,
</p>

<p>
right SMACK back into your headway,
</p>

<p>
like a boomerang, after a long hang
</p>

<p>
When a dear friend wishes to return
</p>

<p>
Shout to them that U felt the yearn
</p>

<p>
to see their shining face
</p>

<p>
U searched through all of space
</p>

<p>
looking for their eyes
</p>

<p>
until U got wise
</p>

<p>
that twinkling stars don't compare
</p>

<p>
to the sparkles in their stare
</p>

<p>
When a dear friend returns
</p>

<p>
Tell them U felt your heart burn
</p>

<p>
let your emotions churn
</p>

<p>
but don't get taciturn
</p>

<p>
as U process their return
</p>

<p>
and feel your relief
</p>

<p>
so much to say, but in brief
</p>

<p>
I. LUV. U.
</p>

<p>
Never leave again. Unless U want to. Then I won't stop U. ILUVU.
