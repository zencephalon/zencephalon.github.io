<ol>
<li>
Minimize Noise

</ol>

<p>
I define noise as any extraneous sound or motion. I wish to achieve graceful
economy in all my motion. I find it a fun challenge to do everyday tasks such as
washing the dishes while making as little noise as I can manage. In physical terms,
sound caused by mechanical motion indicates a loss of energy through inefficiency.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't automatically make me a good listener, but it certainly helps.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Maximize Signal

</ol>

<p>
The yang of the previous rule is that when I do wish to express something, I do
so completely and as effectively as I can. 
</p>
<blockquote>
Express yourself completely,
then keep quiet.
Be like the forces of nature:
when it blows, there is only wind;
when it rains, there is only rain;
when the clouds pass, the sun shines through. <em>The Dao De Jing</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
The logic behind these principles is obvious to me. If I were to transmit two
songs on a single radio band, neither would be heard clearly. Thus I should pick
one message, and transmit it with as little noise as possible.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Minimize Interference

</ol>

<p>
When my signal would interfere with another person's intentional transmission,
then it is preferable to move apart rather than create interference patterns.
</p>

<p>
I feel this is the best way I can respect each person's right to free speech.
</p>

<p>
I will intervene in the case of violence with the intent to harm. This is the
one exception I allow myself. If you aren't physically, mentally, emotionally, 
or spiritually harming someone, I believe I have no say in what you do.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Maximize Mutual Gain

</ol>

<p>
The yang of the previous rule is that when I see the opportunity to, I try to
increase my own signal and those of people around me by combining efforts.
</p>

<p>
I believe that long lasting benefit comes only through mutual benefit. If I 
benefit at the expense of another, then that benefit is ephemeral at best.
</p>

<p>
The analogy in these last two principles to signals interfering when out of phase,
and mutually amplifying when in phase should be obvious.
