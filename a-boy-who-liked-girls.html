Once there was a boy who liked girls. He was bright and curious, and so he caught
on early to how wonderful girls were. He couldn't have been more than four or five.
</p>

<p>
He lived in a like-side town named Excelsior. It was a nice town, and he enjoyed 
going to the library with his father. But most of all, he enjoyed playing with his
friends in the neighborhood. 
</p>

<p>
One of his friends was named Anastasia, and he found her to be beautiful. He only
remembers a few moments with her now. When she showed him the movie <em>Anastasia</em>,
which she liked for an obvious reason. The time she played dress up for him.
Her excitement in as she dressed up. His innocent wonderment at the barest glimpses
of skin. The night he was the only boy who showed up to watch the beauty pageant,
so he could be with her, and they placed a ribbon on him proclaiming him ‘Ms. Something-he-doesn’t-remember’.
He was vaguely aware that he should be embarrassed, but it didn’t matter so long
as he got to see her.
</p>

<p>
Then came the fateful day. He had invited her to a lunch date, of sorts. She came
over to his apartment. And they sat together eating tuna sandwiches his mother had
served. He felt things were going well, and he was happy. Oh, so happy. But unbeknownst 
to him, his mother had invited her friend to come take the trampoline, and her
friend’s children came along.
