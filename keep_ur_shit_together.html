Dear Matthew,
</p>

<p>
U will keep Ur shit together. What does that mean?
</p>

<p>
First we will define <em>shit</em>. Shit consists of all the matter that U consider Urself in charge of. Shit includes Ur body and Ur possessions. Shit does not include other people.
</p>

<p>
If U must keep shit during this life, then U will keep it together. Nobody wants to see Ur shit strewn across a room or an apartment. U will keep Ur shit tidy and organized. For Ur own sake. U will not want to spend too much time searching through Ur shit.
</p>

<p>
U will keep Ur body in shape, keep all the matter it consists of together. Nobody wants to see Ur organs strewn across a room or an apartment.
</p>
