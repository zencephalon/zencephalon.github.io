Meditation reshaped my life for the better. Using meditation I overcame depression, suicidal thoughts, social anxiety, multiple drug addiction, attention deficit disorder, and a gnawing sense of emptiness and nihilism that I couldn't shake for years.

<p>
If U feel perfectly content with Ur life and have no qualms with what U do, then congratulations! U might not need meditation. But if U feel like U might benefit from crisp concentration, accentuated alertness, real relaxation, superb sleep, or habitual happiness, then meditation might suit U.
</p>

<p>
I recommend getting started with mindfulness meditation. U can jump straight in with my <a href="mindfulness meditation guide">mindfulness meditation guide</a>, or if U need more convincing U can read my <a href="mindfulness meditation theory">mindfulness meditation theory</a> page to gain an understanding of how and why it works and what it does, or if U prefer a less anecdotal and more scientific perspective then U can read the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;scholar.google.com&#47;scholar?q=mindfulness+meditation">extensive academic research on mindfulness meditation</a>.
</p>

<p>
When U've made good progress in mindfulness, a good next step is to learn some basic insight meditation. Again, U can jump straight in with my <a href="insight meditation guide">insight meditation guide</a> or U can learn about <a href="insight meditation theory">insight meditation theory</a>, or U can read the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;scholar.google.com&#47;scholar?hl=en&amp;q=vipassana">scholarly articles on insight meditation</a>.
</p>

<p>
If U have quieted Ur mind to the point of emptiness, and now seek an active visualization technique to fill Ur mind with excellent thoughts, try out the <a href="secret_smile_meditation">Secret Smile Meditation</a>.
</p>

<p>
If U feel that U need assistance please <a href="contact me">contact me</a>. I am ready and willing to assist U, and I seek no payment for my services. Rather, I only request that if U find meditation to be of as much value in U life as I have in mine, that U too pass the gift on to friends and loved ones.
