<pre>
How you linger in my mind
asleep I am in your bind
however I run your notes follow
the longing they only exacerbate
deep in my soul there is a hollow
your melodies there reverberate
would that I could bear
knowing you exist
your song I did hear
won't you desist
to dance upon my heart
with your divine art
