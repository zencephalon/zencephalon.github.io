<p>
<em>Dearest Hermes, lord of language, professor of problem solving, warden of wit, instigator of intelligence, avatar of abstraction and automation, bless me, your humble vessel, with creative thought and passionate drive so that I may produce code and writing with alacrity and forethought. As I take your holy sacrament, modafinil, may you grant me unnatural productivity for the next fourteen hours (or until I require rest) so that my dreams may be manifest and so that I may improve the world through your word.</em>
