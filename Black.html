I love holy black
Aye, I declare to thee that black is holy
For in a hole what do we find but black?
</p>

<p>
Bountiful black, goes with any color yet remains undiminished
Like black may I welcome all people and help them shine
Beautiful black, mixes with any color yet remains unchanged
Like black may I embrace all people and with them intertwine
</p>

<p>
Black absorbs all!
Not a mirror to your soul
It does not reflect U
Let black consume U
Black always accepts
It fills your every crack
Stare into the black and U see your own nature
whole, unending, boundless, deep
</p>

<p>
Aye, black, the great mother
Who embraced U in the womb?
Why, black, of course.
U cried when U saw the light
</p>

<p>
The earth sits in her cradle
She gave birth to the sun,
thus we call him the son
</p>

<p>
Black always has space for us
We build walls yet we live in her room
Everywhere we look we see through her
</p>

<p>
Absence is her presence, aye
I love the great mother
we all return to her
</p>
