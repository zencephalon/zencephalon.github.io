<em>Hermes, god of language and program solving, of wit and intelligence, bless me, your humble servant, so that I may produce labor saving code with alacrity and forethought. As I take the holy sacrament, modafinil, may you grant me unnatural productivity for the next five hours, so that project time lines will be met and product road maps mollified.</em>
