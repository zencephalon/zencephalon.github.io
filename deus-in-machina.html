<p>
In two neighboring universe branches of the great world tree, the virtual reality machine is invented.
</p>

<p>
In one world exclusive control of the machine falls into the hands of Axiom Corporation. Money is gradually obsoleted as the realization dawns that anything money could buy, could be had in the machine. Increasingly the people of earth work for Axiom in order to earn Time in the machine. Soon the entire world is The Corporationâ€™s Body. All human endeavour is devoted to fueling the machine. The people are divided into two classes. The Creatives who create new content for the masses to experience in the machine, and the Consumers who labor for the privilege of experiencing the machine. An average laborer may live fifty years, spending a meager five percent of his time in the machine. Meanwhile the presidents of the corporation live forever, suspended in the machine.

<p>
In the other world, the control is made open source. Money is gradually obsoleted. The decision is made that a foundation to provide the machine to all the world will be created. Gradually humans retreat into paradise, leaving robots to maintain the machine. Inside the machine, all are allowed to create. An unprecedented era in human creativity unfolds.
