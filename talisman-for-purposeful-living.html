If you wear a watch, you can charge it with the power of your mind into a magickal talisman. This talisman will remind you manifest your dreams and follow your heart.
</p>

<p>
The charging ritual is very simple. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Sit down, relax deeply, hold your watch in your palms in front of you, and watch its motion carefully as you continue breathing in and out deeply and you may notice a peculiar sensation of time passing.

<li>
With conviction intone:

<li>
“Today, everyday, when I notice my watch I remember that my time is limited.”

<li>
“Today, everyday, when I notice my watch I remember that I will die.”

<li>
“Today, everyday, when I notice my watch I remember that I have a purpose.”

<li>
“Today, everyday, when I notice my watch I work to manifest my dreams.”

<li>
“Today, everyday, when I notice my watch I follow my heart.”

<li>
“Today, everyday, when I notice my watch I live in the moment.”

</ol>

<p>
You can repeat this process every morning until you truly feel reminded every time you look at your watch to do everything in your power in this very moment to live your dream.
