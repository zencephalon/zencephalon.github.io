<em>Ghost Train</em> is somewhat of a sequel to <em>Separation</em>. I was challenging myself by writing from a woman's perspective, specifically Aliza's. Again the writing is in present tense. This time, however, there is a lot more description. I had felt some unresolved feelings after writing <em>Separation</em>, which this story explores a bit. <em>Separation</em> was the first time I felt like I was <em>really</em> writing in that I was making myself as the author very vulnerable in the act. This story then, was my reflection on that.
