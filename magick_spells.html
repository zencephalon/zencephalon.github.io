Should you, as I have, harken back and study the ancient esoteric traditions of magick (magick is to be distinguished from stage magic, which is a subset of magick), you will realize that the ancients considered writing to be the most potent form of magick.
</p>

<p>
This can be seen in our language. We cast ‘spells’. ‘Grimoire’ and ‘grammar’ come from the same root. Writing is one of the most psychoactive substances in the world. Writing can change your mind to a far greater extent than even potent psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
To me, metaphor is magick. ‘Is’ is magick. ‘Is’ is this magickal and potent word that allows us to change one thing into another. Behold this mighty magick which I employ.
</p>

<p>
LIFE is an ADVENTURE
</p>

<p>
EXISTENCE is WONDERMENT
</p>

<p>
DOING THE DISHES is FUN
</p>

<p>
WRITING is MAGICK
</p>

<p>
People use the magick of metaphor all the time in their daily lives, often without realizing it. Read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.soc.washington.edu&#47;users&#47;brines&#47;lakoff.pdf">Metaphors We Live By</a> if you’d like to see some respected academics saying this.
</p>

<p>
Since I have discovered this powerful consciousness altering technique, I have been in search of the most potent spells I can find or create. Please come up with your own and share them! We all benefit from a good spell.
