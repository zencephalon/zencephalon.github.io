<p>
Need to zap bad habits like nail-biting, checking Facebook at work, or sitting
with poor posture? 
</p>

<p>
I like to wear a rubber band around my wrist, both as a reminder of behaviors
I want to eliminate, but also a deterrent. You see, every time I mess up, I simply
pull the rubber band back and <span id="-SNAP"></span><strong id="SNAP">SNAP</strong>. I find it a useful reminder, your mileage
may vary.
