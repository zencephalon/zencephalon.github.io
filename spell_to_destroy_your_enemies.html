Pick the name of someone with whom you have a difficult relationship. I will use Dick Cheney to illustrate.
</p>

<p>
The spell goes like this:
</p>

<p>
<em>I forgive Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney did not come into existence to do me harm. I love Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney came here to learn, as did we all. I forgive Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney learned from his mistakes. I love Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney is one of us. I forgive Dick Cheney.</em>
</p>

<p>
I find this a very effective way to destroy my enemies. I highly recommend you destroy an enemy everyday. Please note, spells have the most effective when read with passion and conviction. Believe in the power of the spell, and its magick will take effect. If you half-heartedly mumble this for weeks, itâ€™ll still work, but not as instantaneously as if you immediately pour your heart into this recitation.
