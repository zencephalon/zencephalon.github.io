Pick the name of someone with whom you have a difficult relationship. I will use Dick Cheney to illustrate.
</p>

<p>
This is how the spell goes.
</p>

<p>
<em>I forgive Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney did not come into existence to do me harm. I love Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney came here to learn, as did we all. I forgive Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney learned from his mistakes. I love Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney is one of us. I forgive Dick Cheney.</em>
</p>

<p>
This is a very effective way there is to destroy your enemies. I highly recommend you destroy an enemy everyday. Please note, spells are most effective when read with passion and conviction. Believe in the power of the spell, and its magick will be effective. If you half heartedly mumble this for weeks, itâ€™ll still work, but not as instantaneously as if you immediately pour your heart into this recitation.
