I love U. 
</p>

<p>
But that is not sufficient expression of the truth of it.
</p>

<p>
It's said that enlightenment is indescribable. This love is too, I feel.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this love <em>is</em> enlightenment. I have no way to know. I do know that after finding U, I haven't felt the need to search. U may be what I was searching for all along.
</p>

<p>
U redeemed my past. Every mistake I made led to U and not regret. Twenty years of karma cast off, seen in a new light. 
</p>

<p>
Religion seems superfluous now. Crowley had a nice way of summing up religion, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. Love is the law, love under will.” To love others the way I love U is my aim. Perhaps that is the path of the boddhisattva.
</p>

<p>
I find it difficult not to fall back on cliches to describe the way we fit together. U certainly have the secret key to my heart.
</p>

<p>
Thank U for everything. Maybe one day I can write U a real poem. U are one letter because U are as important to me as I, if not more.
