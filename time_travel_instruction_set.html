My good friend wrote this same post, which I enjoyed, so I decided to try my hand at a list. Below I've written a list of ten ideas for the ten year old me ten years ago.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Learn whole-heartedly.

<li>
Feel curious about everyone.

<li>
Make fear Ur training partner.

<li>
Power through embarrassment, shame, guilt.

<li>
Cultivate gratitude.

<li>
Find the opportunity in every moment.

<li>
Cherish the time U have with Ur friends and Ur family.

<li>
Remove addictions, build habits.

<li>
Laugh at everything, especially Urself.

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Learn whole-heartedly. Don’t ever learn something half-assedly. If U do, later U will realize when U need to know it, but not know it. This will cause regret. Just learn everything. Ur brain has the capacity. Trust me, U still remember so much stupid trivia about systems U don’t interact with anymore, such as Magic: the Gathering.

<li>
Feel curious about everyone. U may think that shyness saves U time in human interactions, because U only interact with people U deem high quality, but really U just miss opportunities.

<li>
Make fear Ur training partner. Follow it or hunt it. If U don't choose situations where U feel afraid, U stay complacent and stagnant.

<li>
Strike a balance.

<li>
Power through embarrassment, shame, guilt, and other fourth circuit socio-sexual emotions. They can serve other people, but U don't need them. Society uses these emotions as brakes on what would otherwise turn into an out of control acceleration of innovation. As an innovator U will shrug off these feelings and keep working.

<li>
Cultivate gratitude. Appreciate all U have, thank everyone who helps U.

<li>
Eradicate negativity from Ur mind. Find the opportunity in every moment. Sometimes U just have to shift perspectives to find it.

<li>
Cherish the time U have with Ur friends and family. U don’t know how much of it U will get in the future.

<li>
Remove addictions, build habits.

<li>
Laugh at everything, especially Urself.

</ol>
