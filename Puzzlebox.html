<pre>
    what is this heart
    I keep unfolding it
    to find yet another
    origami puzzle of delight
    does it ever end
    inside this strange box
    I have found locks
    do you have a key
    is there a treasure inside
    or is the box itself the prize
    I was given this gift
    by my mother and father
    have they solved the puzzle
    or did it keep going
    why does it keep changing
    I'm puzzled by love
    and I wouldn't have it
    any other way
