I love this spell. I recommend casting it once each day in the morning.
</p>

<p>
<em>Today, everyday, I will embark on a new adventure. It is not over until I have brought joy into another personâ€™s heart. I will rejoice in the endless variety that is the mark of this existence and transmit that joy far and wide.</em>
</p>

<p>
As with all spells, it is best effective when you chant it with conviction and the firm belief that it will work.
