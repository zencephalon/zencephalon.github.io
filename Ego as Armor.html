For most people the ego is a suit of armor. It is meant to protect us. The unfortunate problem is that most people have a very outmodded idea of armor. Platemail is not good armor, and yet this is what I used to wear. My ego was hard, rigid, firm, unbending. Not all that great for navigating new territories.

<p>
That's what an ossified ego is. Because it is so rigid and solid, there are gaps in its defense, and it is encumbering.

The armor I'm trying to build is made of magick-infused-mercurial-nano-bots. It is able to shapeshift, camouflage, sense attacks and reform its shape to deflect them, and generally keep me agile and unencumbered.
