<p>
For most people the ego is a suit of armor. It is meant to protect us. The unfortunate problem is that most people have a very outmodded idea of armor. Platemail is not good armor, and yet this is what I used to wear. My ego was hard, rigid, firm, unbending. Not all that great for navigating new territories.
</p>

<p>
That's what an ossified ego is. Because it is so rigid and solid, there are gaps in its defense, and it is encumbering.
</p>

<p>
The armor I'm trying to build is made of magick-infused-mercurial-nano-bots. It is able to shapeshift, camouflage, sense attacks and reform its shape to deflect them, and generally keep me agile and unencumbered.
