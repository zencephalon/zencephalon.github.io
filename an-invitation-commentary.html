<em>An Invitation</em> is yet another sequel to <em>Separation</em>. Because why not make it a trilogy? I ended up really enjoying writing from Aliza’s perspective, so I decided to do it again. I wasn’t really “over” the girl who inspired Aliza, so I had to write a story giving <em>Separation</em> a more hopeful ending. In this story I was experimenting with characterization, and I tried to create as varied of a cast I could in limited space.
