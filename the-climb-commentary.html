<p>
<em>The Climb</em> is a story I wrote in 2008 that still resonates with me to this day. The struggle of moving apart from friends and loved ones in order to achieve new heights is something I have to deal with every day in New York. I enjoy the purity of the concept in this story. I especially love the scene at the summit of the climb. I chose the name Nora because I was enamored with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.imdb.com&#47;name&#47;nm0954253&#47;">Nora Zehetner</a> after her superlative performance in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.imdb.com&#47;title&#47;tt0393109&#47;">Brick</a>.
