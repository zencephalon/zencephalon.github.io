What need have I for the fictions of other men? Does not my own life suffice to echo through the halls of memory until the end of time? I shall build my mythos through will.

<p>
Avalokitesvara looks upon me in her manifestation as Guanyin Boddhisattva. I charge her amulet granting "lifetime peace, smooth work" through the giving of charitable alms.
</p>

<p>
I, of the dual nature, Esil and Isar.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I will hide my secret sword, smile my secret smile.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I choose to hide as much muscle as possible. I will become as strong as possible while looking as slender as possible. My strength will come as a surprise, for in surprise I find yet more strength.
