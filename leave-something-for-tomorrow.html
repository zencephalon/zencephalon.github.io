Dear Matt,
</p>

<p>
You are just brimming over with ideas right now, I can tell. Your mind is a cauldron, cooking up many heady brews. And yet I urge you, hold back! You do not want your enthusiasm to waver. You should go to bed each night with some ideas in you, so that you wake up in the morning motivated to write. You’ll also have the benefit of stewing over those ideas in your sleep, where your unconscious can truly add an innovative spin.
</p>

<p>
You want to establish a daily habit of writing, so don’t make the mistake you had made in the past of working too intensely and then burning out. To be sure, you will burn things up. But this is a controlled burn. That way you don’t scorch yourself.
</p>
